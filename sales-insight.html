            <h1>Sales Insight of a Global Superstore</h1>
            <p>Worked on a random store dataset. It had a vast sales data and I checked for inconsistency using filters on Excel, dealt with some formatting issues. After the cleaning part I 
                jumped into the visualization part.</p>

        <div class="project-report">
            <p>This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the global superstore's performance through a dynamic and insightful Power BI dashboard. 
                The dashboard focuses on three key performance indicators (KPIs) - <b>Total Sales</b>, <b>Total Profit</b>, and <b>Average Shipping Time</b>. The first two
                KPIs were pretty straight forward, but for the third one I had to use <b>Quick Measure</b> on Power BI. Additionally, 
                it provides users with the flexibility to explore data using three slicers for country, category, and year (2012-2015).
            </p>
            <p><b>Key Findings:</b>
                <ol><li><b>Total Sales & Profits:</b> The line-column chart displays the monthly sales and profits year by year while the bar chart shows top 5 countries
                where total sales were the highest.</li>
                <li><b>Customer Segmentation:</b> The pie chart depicts the revenue percentage generated by 
                    customer segments (consumer, home office and conporate).</li>
            </ol>
            This visualization provides all the key insights. From the line-column chart it is clear that every year <b>Nov-Dec</b> sales are higher. So
            stragies can be made to invest more on these two months. The pie chart denotes that the most lucrative segment is <b>Consumers</b>. So marketing should
            team should focus more on consumers.
            </p>

            <div>
                <p>So now suppose, someone wants to see how the business performed in the <b>US</b> in <b>2014</b>
                </p>
                <img class="project-img" src="sales on US.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>We can filter across countries using the slicer on the top left and navigate through the 
                years using the slicer from the top right.
