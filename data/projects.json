    "content": "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">I wanted to move beyond static datasets from Kaggle and work with something \"live.\" I decided to build an automated pipeline that pulls real-time weather data for Dhaka using the Open-Meteo API. The raw data came in JSON format, which was quite extensive but needed structure to be useful. While fetching the data was straightforward using Python\u2019s requests library, managing the storage efficiently proved to be a bit tricky. I didn't want to just dump everything into a CSV and create a mess. To streamline the process, I used Pandas to clean the data and filter for specific conditions (like temperatures above 20\u00b0C). Instead of standard CSVs, I decided to save the output as Parquet files. This optimized the storage significantly and preserved the data types, which saved me from having to re-cast columns later in Power BI.</div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/etl_notebook.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now that I had optimized, structural data, I dived into visualization using Power BI. Since I used Parquet, the connection was seamless. I created a dynamic dashboard that doesn't just show a static history. Using relative date filtering and time-binning, I can now see specific hourly trends for \"Today\" alongside a 3-day forecast of maximum and minimum temperatures. It gives me an instant snapshot of the weather right now, without needing to manually refresh or clean a spreadsheet.</div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/etl_pbi.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"></div>",

I decided to clean it up by removing those null columns and started my analysis. While getting total cases and total deaths was straightforward using Power BI, calculating metrics like vaccinations per hundred people and death rates proved to be a bit tricky. The nature of the dataset was such that it provided daily updates, resulting in numerous duplicates. To streamline the data, I undertook manipulations to derive the total population and the number of people vaccinated for each country.</div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/covid-script.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><div><br></div><div>After obtaining the data, I created a new sheet where I calculated the vaccination percentage of people for each country and later used it for visualization.</div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/popvac sheet.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><br></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Next up, I needed to determine the death rate (how many people are dying per hundred cases) for each country.
