            <p class="about-text">Hi! My name is <b><a class="mtb" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahirtb/" target="_blank">Mahir</a></b>, and I am currently pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of Asia Pacific.
            I am working on my thesis, focusing on dental implant detection using deep learning. In the past four years, I tried a little bit of everything there is in the CS field, but nothing got me hooked like <b>data</b>.
            I discovered SQL during the last phase of COVID and found joy in experimenting with it, even though it was pretty basic stuff. Later 
            on, I took an academic course on Database Management System where I learned more about SQL. Subsequnetly, I came across Power BI and started making dashboards for fun.
            Fast forward almost two years, and now I aspire to be a <b>Data Analyst</b>. For now, I am learning about ETL processes and Data Warehouse.
            Alongside my technical pursuits, I have a keen interest in marketing and business, and it's fascinating to see how data complements both fields seamlessly<br>
            I am actively seeking <b>remote internship/entry-level opportunities</b> as a data analyst.
